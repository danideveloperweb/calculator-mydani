# calculator-mydani

Sure, here's how you can download and install the calculator-mydani I created in the previous question and how to use it:

Step 1: Install the library

To install thecalculator-mydani, you can use the following command in your terminal:

npm install calculator-mydani

This will download and install the library and its dependencies in your project.

Step 2: Import the library

To use the functions in the library, you need to import them in your TypeScript file. You can do this with the following code:

import { sum, subtract, multiply, divide } from 'calculator-mydani';

This imports the sum, subtract, multiply, and divide functions from thecalculator-mydani package.

Step 3: Use the library

Now that you have imported the library, you can use its functions in your code. Here's an example of how you could use the sum function:

const result = sum(2, 3);
console.log(result); // Output: 5

This code calls the sum function with the arguments 2 and 3 and assigns the result to the result variable. It then logs the result to the console, which should output 5.

You can use the other functions in the same way, by calling them with the appropriate arguments.

And that's it! You have now downloaded, installed, and used the calculator library in your TypeScript project.
